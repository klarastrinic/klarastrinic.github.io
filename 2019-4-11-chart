    <p class="w3-justify"> The Black Parade is album by My Chemical Romance released in 2006. It was produced by Rob Cavallo. <br>
    The album debuted at number two on both the Billboard 200 and the UK Albums Chart <br> 
    and is also certified as Triple Platinum by the RIAA.
    I never took a chance to listen anything from this band. So I just went to Spotify and<br> 
      I choose this album to listen. I loved every song on it. Melodically, vocally <br>
      and lyrically this album is awesome. I literally didn’t skipped any song.<br>
My favorite track on this album is The End. “If you look in the mirror and don't like what you see<br>
You can find out, first hand, what it's like to be me”<br>
He is talking about struggle with self confidence and the feeling of being an outsider. He is showing sympathy <Br>
      and relation to those who aren’t confident in themselves and their bodies.>Br>

Another favorite track is Teenagers. The song was written by Gerard when he was on a subway and<Br>
      had a panic attack because there were so many teenagers riding on it as well.<BR>
      When guitarist Frank Iero heard the song for the first time, he thought it was a joke<Br>
