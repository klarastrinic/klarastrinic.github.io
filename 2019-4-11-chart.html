    <h2 class="w3-wide">Best 16 rap songs of 2019</h2>
   
  
    <p class="w3-justify"> 
      This is just my opinion, don't take it too serious.<br>
      So let's start. 2019 was year important for hip-hop. Too many amazing albums were released <br> 
      like IGOR, Hollywood's Bleeding and too many others. So let's just take a look of the rap songs that<br>
      I enjoyed the most. <Br> <br>
       
      
      <b> 16. Panini by Lil Nas X <br><br></b>
      I really love this song, but song becomes boring by time and<Br>
      that's why I give this song 6/7. <br>
      The song peaked number 5 on Billiboard chart Hot 100 <Br>
      Personally I loved the song. <br> <br> <Br>
      
      <B> 15. Babushka Boi by A$AP Rocky <Br> <Br> </b>
      “Babushka” is Russian for “grandmother” or “elderly woman,” <Br>
      and it’s also a type of Russian headscarf tied under the chin, <BR>
      traditionally worn by women from Eastern Europe. <Br>
      In November 2018, A$AP Rocky appeared at the LACMA <Br>
      Art+Film Gala in Los Angeles, wearing a $495 Gucci babushka.<BR>
      This song is pure masterpiece
        <Br> <Br> <br>
      <b>    14. Through the Motions by Lil Skies<br> <br> </b>
          ‘Through the Motions’ is the 11th track on Lil Skies' 2nd studio album Shelby dedicated to his mother. <br>
          Lil Skies talks about how he’s came up from nothing, going through the<Br>
          motions on how people changed their opinion on him being<br>
          irrelevant to full spot on relevancy mostly because <br>
          of his clout he’s receiving and the drip he’s<Br>
          wearing and that he’s on the move making plays.
        <Br> <br> <br>  
<B>   13. WHY by NF</B><Br> <br>
      This is what artist said about a song, "I feel like I am at <Br>
          a place in my life right now, which I’ve been at for a long time and <Br>
          I’m just trying to work through a lot of the <Br>
          problems I talk about. It sucks sometimes because <Br>
          I wish I could talk about how I got through it. <Br>
          “WHY” is just a song where I’m just asking <Br>
          myself a bunch of questions like I’m having a lot of realizations."<Br>
          <Br>  <b>favorite part of the song:</b><Br>
          <i> "I, I don't care what anybody else thinks—lies (Haha)<Br>
I do not need nobody to help me—lies<Br>
           I kinda feel guilty 'cause I'm wealthy; why?"</i>
          <BR>
          
       <br> <bR>
          <b>12. Homicide by Logic feat. Eminem <BR> <Br></b>
            Yes, there is an extensive, originally one-sided history between the two. <br>
            Logic has often cited Eminem as a major influence on his music.<br>

On his August 2018 track, “Fall,” Eminem raps:<br>
           <i> "I inspired the Hopsins, the Logics, the Coles, the Seans, the K-Dots, the 5'9"s,
             and oh"</i>
This marked possibly the first time<br>
            Eminem publicly acknowledged Logic.<br>
The two first met in February 2019, when Logic <br>
            opened for Eminem at a concert in Hawaii.<br>
            <br><br>
            <B>11. Middle Child by J. Cole <br><BR></b>
              On the track, Cole envisions himself in the center of the old<br>
              and new generations of hip-hop, therefore making him the “middle child” of rap.<br>
“Middle Child Syndrome” is a psychological condition <br>
              in which middle children sometimes feel <br>
              neglected by their families due to the attention<br> 
              that their younger and older siblings receive.<br>
            <br><BR>
              <B>10. Lalala by Y2K feat. bbno$</b><br>
                bbno$: I remember, the day we made this song, I sat down<br>
                and Ari has a little couch, and that couch is messed up from another rapper.<br> 
                I was moving to the left and all I said to Ari, I was like, “Cardi B, I like it like that.”<br> 
                And you know, he started playing at riff. I started going, nah, nah, nah, nah, nah. <br>
                And we both turned at each other and kind of just made a hit I guess.<br>
Ari: It’s funny cause he had never sang a song before that day. This was literally<br>
                the first time that he had ever tried singing on a song. <Br>
                And so, I think he was sing rapping another’s on kind of. I was like,<br>
                “Oh yeah, you have good tone.” Which you can’t recreate. You can fix pitch<br>
                and all that, but you can’t fix tone. And so it was kind of an interesting situation.<br> 
                Just first time you ever singing on a track just turned out insane.<br>
              <br><BR>
              <B>9. Circles by Post Malone</b><Br>
              “Circles” is the fourth single from Post Malone’s third studio album, <br>
              Hollywood’s Bleeding. The track continues the heartbreak theme from “Goodbyes” <br> 
              as he struggles to maintain a strong relationship with this girl. Like “Goodbyes,”<Br>
              “Circles” fell victim to leaks before official announcements. <br>
              A snippet of the track originally surfaced online in July of 2019, with the full<br>
              song being leaked online later in August.<br>
              <Br> <Br>
                <b>8. Take What You Want</b><br>
                “Take What You Want” is a super bitchin', legendary record. Shoutout to Ozzy.<br>
                Ozzy Osbourne. That’s fucking it. That’s all I gotta say really. A super talented<br>
                friend of mine, Andrew Watt, told me Ozzy wanted to do a song with me,<Br>
                but I did not think it would actually happen. After my recent <Br>
                tour ended, I got a FaceTime from Ozzy and Watt and now <br>
                it is a smush [sic] hit. What an explosion!<Br><br>
             <br>
                <b>7. West Coast by G-Eazy feat. Blueface (Remix) </b><BR><br>
                This song is G-Eazy, Blueface, ALLBLACK and YG ode to the West <br>
                Coast of the U.S.; the 4 grew up in Oakland and Los Angeles, respectively.<Br>
                Throughout the song plays a pitched-up vocal sample of “Let’s Ride” by Bay Area<br>                                                                                                 
                legend Richie Rich. Additionally, <br>
                the music video features cameos from fellow West Coast musicians such as E-40,<br>
                Ty Dolla $ign, and Richie Rich himself.<br>
                <BR><br><br>
                  <b>6. EARFQUAKE</b><BR><br>
                    In an interview with Rick Rubin on his podcast Broken Record, Tyler explains that his inspiration<br>
                    for the title came from there being an actual earthquake when he was writing the song. <br>
                    Then he just decided to change the “th” to an “f.”<br>
During Tyler’s concert hosted by Apple Music with IGOR presentation, <Br>
                    Tyler said the song is from 2017 and he wrote it for Justin Bieber, <br>
                    but “he didn’t take it.” It was also offered to Rihanna but she also declined.<br>
                    <BR>
                      <Br>
                        <B>5. Follow God by Kanye West<Br><Br></b>
                          Kanye West revisits the spiritual themes of his February 2016 track, <br>
                          “Father Stretch My Hands, Pt. 1,” on its 2019 successor, “Follow God.” <br>
                          On the soulful track, Kanye flips a sample of Whole Truth’s 1974 track,<Br>
                          “Can You Lose By Following God” to discuss the way he struggles to live a religious<br> 
                          life and follow God’s direction in face of the difficulties that God presents.<Br>
                          <br><BR>
                          <b>4. I by Lil Skies </b><br><br>
                          The inspiration is just me, is where I go to, life. 
                          I would say life, that’s it. Just life situations. Real things in life. <br>
                          I was trying to touch people and get them somethin'<br>
                          to relate to and be real with my fans. Relationship problems, <br>
                          life’s depression, everything. And me, I just wanted to be real myself in this song.<br>
                          Like me talking to myself pretty much in this song. <br>
                          I didn’t know that was going to be the first track on my album, but when I did it,<br>
                          and I was working on the album, I was just feeling that this gotta be the first track.<br>
                          <br> <br>
                          <b>3. Goodbyes by Post Malone</b><Br><BR>
                          
Throughout the song, Post sings about troubles with a girl and expresses his <br>
                          desire to remove her from his life, while Thug’s part seems to <Br>
                          suggest that he’s trying to reconnect with a girl, <br>
                          which is in complete contrast to the rest of the song.<Br>
                          A snippet of the song originally surfaced online on March 12, 2019,<br>
                          and the full song leaked on March 14, 2019. After speculation by various <Br>
                          media outlets, Post confirmed the track would be released on July 5, 2019, in a Twitter post.<br>
                                                                                                                            
<BR><Br>
  <B>2. Devil's Work by Joyner Luucas <br></b>
After more than 6 months since he announced his new album ADHD<br>
  and releasing the lead single for it titled <br>
  “I Love,” Joyner comes back with a second single, “Devil’s Work.”<br>

Influenced by recent tragic deaths of rappers such as XXXTENTACION<br>
  and Nipsey Hussle, Joyner pours out his heart in this song that serves<br>
  as message to God, filled with many queries which question God’s<br>
  motives and reasoning, with the main one being<br>
  
  “Why do you take good people from us and leave the bad ones?”<br>
  <br><Br>
  <b>1. The Ringer by Eminem</b><br><br>
  “The Ringer” sees Eminem continuing his criticism of the state of hip-hop in 2018,<br> 
  focusing especially on mumble rappers, some of whom he calls out by name like Lil Xan and Lil Pump.<br>

The song also continues themes he explored on 2018’s “Chloraseptic<br>
  (Remix).” Specifically, Eminem criticizes the double standards of the public<br>
  towards him in the wake of his 9th album, Revival. Critics are rewarded for pushing negative<br> 
  views about him, but should he retaliate he falls further in their esteem.<br>

Finally, Em also takes aim at Donald Trump again, pointing out<br> 
  that the President has yet to answer his 2017 BET Hip-Hop Awards Cypher<br> 
  Verse as well as several other missives he sent on Revival.<br>
                          </p>
