      This is just my opinion, don't take it too serious.<br>
      So let's start. 2019 was year important for hip-hop. Too many amazing albums were released <br> 
      like IGOR, Hollywood's Bleeding and too many others. So let's just take a look of the rap songs that<br>
      I enjoyed the most. <Br> <br>
       
      
      <b> 16. Panini by Lil Nas X <br><br></b>
      I really love this song, but song becomes boring by time and<Br>
      that's why I give this song 6/7. <br>
      The song peaked number 5 on Billiboard chart Hot 100 <Br>
      Personally I loved the song. <br> <br> <Br>
      
      <B> 15. Babushka Boi by A$AP Rocky <Br> <Br> </b>
      “Babushka” is Russian for “grandmother” or “elderly woman,” <Br>
      and it’s also a type of Russian headscarf tied under the chin, <BR>
      traditionally worn by women from Eastern Europe. <Br>
      In November 2018, A$AP Rocky appeared at the LACMA <Br>
      Art+Film Gala in Los Angeles, wearing a $495 Gucci babushka.<BR>
      This song is pure masterpiece
        <Br> <Br> <br>
      <b>    14. Through the Motions by Lil Skies<br> <br> </b>
          ‘Through the Motions’ is the 11th track on Lil Skies' 2nd studio album Shelby dedicated to his mother. <br>
          Lil Skies talks about how he’s came up from nothing, going through the<Br>
          motions on how people changed their opinion on him being<br>
          irrelevant to full spot on relevancy mostly because <br>
          of his clout he’s receiving and the drip he’s<Br>
          wearing and that he’s on the move making plays.
        <Br> <br> <br>  
<B>   13. Why by NF</B><Br> <br>
      This is what artist said about a song, "I feel like I am at <Br>
          a place in my life right now, which I’ve been at for a long time and <Br>
          I’m just trying to work through a lot of the <Br>
          problems I talk about. It sucks sometimes because <Br>
          I wish I could talk about how I got through it. <Br>
          “WHY” is just a song where I’m just asking <Br>
          myself a bunch of questions like I’m having a lot of realizations." <BR>
    </p>
